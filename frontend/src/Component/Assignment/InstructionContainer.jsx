                Two arrays are said to be compatible if they are of the same size and if the ith element in the first array is greater than or equal to the ith element in the second array for all i elements.

                Write a Java program to find whether 2 arrays are compatible or not. If the arrays are compatible display the message as "Arrays are Compatible" if not then display the message as "Arrays are Not Compatible".
